# AoE2Calendar.com: a calendar for pro Age of Empires

#### Management interface
![Edit](http://i.imgur.com/d1V90Awl.png)

#### Contributing
  - AoE2calendar is  written in React, specifically [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
  - Collaborating:
    - there's a small Discord group to discuss planning, ping me on Discord (patão#8153) and I'll add you :)
    - to get access to the source sheet just ping me on Discord (patão#8153) or AoCzone.net (patao)
  - You can use `yarn install` or `npm install` to install - I prefer `yarn` for speed
  - Run with  `npm run dev`. Hot reloading is enabled for development.
  - Feel free to open Github issues, I'll check them!

##### Plan
  - The goal for the site itself is to eventually add more features like VoDs as well as integrations with other AoE2 projects
  - A side-goal for the project is to drive an event calendar on reddit.com and possibly for aoczone.net / streamers as well

##### Notes
  - Hot reloading requires running on localhost. If you're running remotely, you can use Fiddler to remap localhost to remote IP.
